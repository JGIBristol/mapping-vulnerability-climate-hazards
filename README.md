This repository contains the code used in the analysis for:

* Howkins, J. et al. "Mapping vulnerability to climate-related hazards to inform local authority
action in adaptation," [In Prep.]

## Overview

In disasters, there are three broad areas of risk to health:

* the hazard that can cause damage,
* exposure to the hazard,
* the vulnerability (or adaptive capacity) of the exposed population.

We first consider the two hazards **heat** and **flooding**, estimating the exposure of people in
South Gloucestershire. We then estimate the **vulnerability** of those people. We finally calculate
an overall risk using our vulnerability estimate and either of the heat or flooding exposure
estimates.

We perform these calculations at the level of Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs). These are UK
statistical geographies covering 1,000-3,000 people each.

## Instructions

This code is written in Python and there is a combination of `.py` scripts and `.ipynb` Jupyter
Notebooks. There is also a `justfile` that will run all parts of the pipeline automatically.

All the necessary dependencies can be installed using conda.

To run the entire processing pipeline, you will need to:

* Have access to **HadUK-Grid data** - this is a very large dataset! You can download the specific
  files required, however it is much easier to use a high performance computing (HPC) cluster that
  provides access to the dataset already. One example of such a system is
  [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk) and the [CEDA Archive](https://archive.ceda.ac.uk).
* Have access to **Fathom flood level data** - you will need to have a current data sharing
  agreement in place with [Fathom](https://fathom.global).
* Have downloaded the **Building layer from OS OpenMap - Local** - access to the dataset is provided
  for free on the [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenMapLocal). Choose an
  ESRI® Sharefile covering at least the area you are interested in. Only the `ST_Building` layer is
  required.

The outline process is as follows:

1. Create a conda environment using `environment-frozen.yml` (or `environment.yml`).
    - `conda env create -n southglos -f environment-frozen.yml`
2. Ensure the raw data is in place:
    - `hazard/data/input/buildings/` - from OS Open Data,
    - `hazard/data/input/fathom/` - proprietary data from Fathom,
    - `hazard/data/input/buildings/` - pre-processed data from HadUK-Grid (run
      `calculate_heat_hazard_indicators.py` on an appropriate HPC with access to the HadUK-Grid
      dataset),
    - vulnerability data will be downloaded automatically.
3. Use `just` to run the processing from your activated conda environment:
    - `conda activate southglos`
    - `just overall`
4. Review outputs:
    - Heat hazard
        - `hazard/data/output/heat/`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Heat_hazard_analysis`
    - Flooding hazard
        - `hazard/data/output/flooding/`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Flooding_hazard_analysis.html`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Flooding_hazard_analysis_disaster.html`
    - Vulnerability
        - `vulnerability/data/06_index/`
        - `vulnerability/notebooks/Developing_vulnerability_indicators.html`
    - For demonstration purposes only, an example of an overall risk assessment
        - `vulnerability/data/07_overall/`
        - `vulnerability/notebooks/Overall_risk_assessment.html`
