## Instructions

1. Create a conda environment using `environment-frozen.yml` (or `environment.yml`).
2. Ensure the raw data is in place:
    - `hazard/data/input/buildings/` - from OS Open Data,
    - `hazard/data/input/fathom/` - proprietary data from Fathom,
    - `hazard/data/input/buildings/` - pre-processed data from HadUK-Grid (run `calculate_heat_hazard_indicators.py` on an appropriate HPC with access to the HadUK-Grid dataset),
    - vulnerability data will be downloaded automatically.
3. Use `just` to run the processing:
    - `$ just overall`
4. Review outputs:
    - Heat hazard
        - `hazard/data/output/heat/`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Heat_hazard_analysis`
    - Flooding hazard
        - `hazard/data/output/flooding/`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Flooding_hazard_analysis.html`
        - `hazard/notebooks/Flooding_hazard_analysis_disaster.html`
    - Vulnerability
        - `vulnerability/data/06_index/`
        - `vulnerability/notebooks/Developing_vulnerability_indicators.html`
    - For demonstration purposes only, an example of an overall risk assessment
        - `vulnerability/data/07_overall/`
        - `vulnerability/notebooks/Overall_risk_assessment.html`
