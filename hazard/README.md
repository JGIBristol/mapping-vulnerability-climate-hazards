# Hazard exposure data processing

## Approach

### Flooding

Flooding data under historic and future scenarios was kindly provided by Fathom, a UK-based flood
hazard intelligence company[^1].

A dataset was created of a 1 in 100-year event at a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5
scenario in 2050, representing a 'typical' flood preparation scenario, as well as a 'disaster'
scenario using 1 in 1000-year modelling with the same projections. These scenarios are equivalent to
those used by the UK Environment Agency for flood hazard zoning, but with a higher spatial
resolution of 10m and additionally adjusted for climate change[^2].

Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), UK statistical geographies covering 1,000-3,000 people each,
were ranked as deciles by the aggregated proportion of buildings that experience any coastal,
fluvial, or pluvial flooding greater than 10 cm, anywhere in their footprint.

### Heat

Heat data was extracted from the Met Office's HadUK-Grid dataset at 1 km horizontal spatial
resolution[^3].

This historical data was used due to improved resolution above UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) and
as it fulfilled the requirements for the feasibility nature of this study. To isolate the warm
season in the current climate, we limited the data to June, July, and August (JJA) in the period
2015-2019.

Datasets were created for the average JJA maximum temperature from the data to represent average
summer daytime temperatures, as well as the proportion of days where the average temperature
exceeded 15°C, the mean temperature above which mortality risks in Southwest England
increase[^4][^5].

In each case, LSOAs were ranked as deciles by the weighted average of these
metrics, weighted according to the density of buildings within each LSOA.

## Key files and directories

This directory contains code and data for the heat and flooding hazard exposure analysis.

* [`code/`](code/)

    * [`calculate_heat_hazard_indicators.py`](code/calculate_heat_hazard_indicators.py) - Generates gridded input data for the heat hazard
      analysis (average maximum temperature and days exceeding threshold metrics) from HadUK-Grid
      data. Designed to be run in advance on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster that
      provides access to the HadUK-Grid dataset.
